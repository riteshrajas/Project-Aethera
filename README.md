# Project Aethera

**Project Aethera is the successor to Pyintel, an AI created by Ritesh.**

This project aims to be the next biggest advancement in AI, creating a powerful and useful AI system with multi-point control. It will be capable of doing everything from building AI-powered applications to rating entire databases using only voice commands. Project Aethera is designed as a personal assistant that learns on command, drawing inspiration from capabilities like Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S. and general AI wrapper functionalities.

## Features
